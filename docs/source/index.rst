How to use this report
----------------------

Most of the pages in this report feature charts rendered by `plotly <https://plotly.com/>`_. Some of these charts contain a *lot* of information. Fortunately, they are interactive. You may find the following tips particularly useful:

* You can double-click on any item in the legend to focus on it.
* You can single-click on any item in the legend to toggle its presence.
* You can zoom, pan, and download as ``.png``.

We also recommend viewing on a wide-screen display if possible.
